Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game!

Description
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a gallows being drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

2. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list or dictionary.
3. You'll be presented with a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word.
4. Guess letters one at a time by typing them into the game.
5. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding blank space(s).
6. If the letter is not in the word, a part of the gallows will be drawn.
7. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
8. You win the game if you guess the word correctly within the specified number of attempts.
9. You lose the game if you run out of attempts before guessing the word.
